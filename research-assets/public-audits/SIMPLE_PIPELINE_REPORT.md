# Simple pipeline website job

Owner instruction: October 10, 2026, evening. This report records only measured results. The audit lane stays paused; new contributions retain `source_extracted`. Source PDFs, full text, pass files and pair files with quotes remain local. Site records contain locators without quotes.

## Part A

In progress: both supplied patches and 27 COD reference cells are applied. All 152 JavaScript tests pass, including 14 default-cell regressions; five status/counter and 21 release-route regressions pass. The first complete candidate build passed all 13 stages, 212 Python tests and 162,707 quality checks. It contained 25,177 files and 1,058,028,840 bytes. A browser check found that an explicitly quantified tetragonal/monoclinic mixture hid both cells. This selection defect is corrected; the fresh complete build, browser validation, source CI, merge and anonymous deployment remain pending. This engineering release adds zero papers.

## Part B

Completed fresh extraction of the same 15 development main-text PDFs with Qwen3-32B Q4_K_M, 32,768 context and thinking off. All 30 passes succeeded. Extraction took 26.0253 wall-clock minutes. The current prompt is retained because 328 values were kept and zero passes failed; no prompt rerun was needed. No held-out papers were processed.

These are DOI-level matches against recorded values, not an independent determination of product/step accuracy or calibration.

## Choices and fixes

- Recommended choice: keep optical fields out of converted website records; the converter default avoids the optical errors observed in the earlier test.
- Require two successful passes before production `check`; retry a failed pass pair once with `--redo`, then leave the paper out. Fixed the checker to reject missing, failed or malformed A/B passes and move stale outputs outside the converter input folder; 19 synthetic regressions pass.
- Fixed two default-cell defects: an unknown reported phase cannot be treated as missing, and conflicting qualifiers cannot admit an incompatible cell. Reported product phase takes precedence over intended target; manually bound cells are unchanged.
- Registered exact COD archive-comment exceptions for new supplied CIF paths and hashes; coordinate bytes and the existing comment validator are unchanged.
- Used the existing public-report path after the source boundary rejected a new unlisted report folder; no path rule was widened.
- Converter fixes: original figure captions remain local; published captions contain only figure/page/category locators. Separate model passes are not called an independent audit.
- Public export now recursively removes quote fields and private paths, and replaces source captions with locator captions; four synthetic regressions pass.
- Extended ordinary Reader, source coverage and release-route bindings for explicitly labelled source-extracted records. DOI/record/page/browser bindings and training exclusion remain required; audited route checks are unchanged.
- Fixed the browser-discovered mixed-phase selector: separate explicitly percentage-labelled phase clauses may select parallel references; compatible qualifiers remain conjunctive.
- No release check has been removed or switched off.

## Batches

No simple-pipeline batch has been deployed yet. Batch 1 contains 20 screened papers: generation is running on 18 supported identities; two papers are held for unresolved DOI identity, not classified as lacking a recipe. Eight trusted metadata DOI overrides and ten printed PDF DOIs support the generated cohort. Selection and extraction add no public paper credit.
